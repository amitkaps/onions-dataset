Data.gov.in - This is normally a good place to get government data in a machine readable form like csv or xml. The Variety-wise Daily Market Prices Data of Onion is available for each year as an XML/JSON but unfortunately it does not include quantity information that is needed. It would be good to have both price and quantity - so even though this is easy, lets see if we can get both from a different source. Here is the best link to go to get what is available - https://data.gov.in/catalog/variety-wise-daily-market-prices-data-onion#web_catalog_tabs_block_10

Agmarket - This is the website run by the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI), Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India and provides daily price and arrival data for all agricultural commodities at national and state level. Unfortunately, the link to get Market-wise Daily Report for Specific Commodity (Onion for us) leads to a multipage aspx entry form to get data for each date. So it is like to require an involved scraper to get the data.
